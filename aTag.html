First of all, I would like to thank all the coordinating instituions of NPTEL for creating such a wonderful platform. It gave me an opportunity to learn the subjects across disciplines. It was like sitting in the classroom of the professor of best institutions in the world. They delivered their research experience within the short period. This has paved the way for the digital era in India. Last but not the least, NPTEL has enlightened my life."

Today I took the certification exam for the course “The joy of computing using Python”, after completing the course.The course is designed remarkably. Everything covered is very useful and can be applied in real life scenarios. Though the application of python is covered on very high level, it still gives you enough kick to start with. The course is divided into different sections with name as “Cool Ideas i (where i in range (1,10). Ideas are really cool. I work at IBM specialised in ETL and Automation Testing. The course has designed weekly programming assignment which helps you apply your learning directly.And at the end you get to take the certification exam

NPTEL content is useful in filling the gap in learning. Here, one can learn from the best teachers in the country. For me NPTEL is the best platform for online learning since there is no prequalification, no age limit, and no entrance criteria to enrol. I feel myself privileged to be in the line of eminent learners from the world known organizations like ISRO, DRDO, Chennai Metro, and TCS etc.
